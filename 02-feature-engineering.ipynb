In a conventional programming language or database schema, we'd use enumerated types (C programmers may want to use distinguished small integers) to model categories of things, but those aren't suitable for input to machine learning algorithms.\n",

We want a representation that makes sure that manual transactions are similar to other manual transactions in some way _but dissimilar to all other transactions_ in that way.\n",

(t-SNE also works best for visualizing two-dimensional data when it is reducing from tens of dimensions rather than hundreds or thousands.  So, in some cases, you'll want to use a fast technique like PCA to reduce your data to a few dozen dimensions before using t-SNE.  That's what we're doing with the `TruncatedSVD` class in the next cell.)\n",
