However, while individual trees in random decision forests [focus on different subsets of features](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrap_aggregating) to reduce variance and avoid overfitting, gradient boosting trains new weak learners to focus on examples that were mispredicted in the existing ensemble.\n",

    "#### Dealing with Imbalanced Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "When the training data set contains unequal representation from each of your classes we say we are dealing with 'imbalanced classes'. In our data set fewer than 2% of the samples are fraudulent, and the remaining 98% are legitimate. Thus we have imbalanced classes. \n",
    "\n",
    "This causes problems for a few reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A model which classifies all transactions as 'legitimate' would be correct 98% of the time. This high accuracy can trick you into thinking that your model is working well, despite it just returning 'legitimate' for every sample it sees. \n",
    "2. Even if your model tries to learn patterns in the data, it may struggle to learn from the fraudulent transactions since there simply aren't enough of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "XGBoost will address this problem by weighting mispredicted classes more heavily automatically, and this is the approach we'll take.  We can also give XGBoost a hint to explicitly weight classes in training before it automatically identifies imbalance; we'll get counts of classes in the training data now so that we can weight them later."
